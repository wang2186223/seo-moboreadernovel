    "description": "Alpha werewolves should be cruel and merciless with unquestionable strength and authority, at least that’s what Alpha Charles Redmen believes and he doesn’t hesitate to raise his kids to be the same way. Alpha Cole Redmen is the youngest of six born to Alpha Charles and Luna Sara Mae, leaders of the Red Fang pack. Born prematurely, Alpha Charles rejected him without hesitation as weak and undeserving of his very life. He is reminded daily of his father’s hatred for him paving the way for the rest of his family to become the same. By adulthood, his father’s hatred and abuse towards him has spilled over into the rest of the pack making him the scapegoat for those with the sadistic need to see him suffer. The rest are simply too afraid to even look his way leaving him little in the way of friends or family to turn to.\nAlpha Demetri Black is the leader of a sanctuary pack known as Crimson Dawn. It’s been years since a wolf has made their way to his pack via the warrior’s prospect program but that doesn’t mean he’s not looking for the tell tale signs of a wolf in need of help. Malnourished and injured upon his arrival, Cole’s anxious and overly submissive demeanor lands him in the very situation he’s desperate to avoid, in the attention of an unknown alpha. Yet somehow through the darkness of severe illness and injury he runs into the very person he’s been desperate to find since he turned eighteen, his Luna. His one way ticket out of the hell he’s been born into. Will Cole find the courage needed to leave his pack once and for all, to seek the love and acceptance he’s never had?",

When his true love reappeared, Julian tossed a divorce contract her way. \"She's back. We're finished,\" he said flatly. The secret of her pregnancy stayed hidden Yvonne fought the urge to cry, signed her freedom, and disappeared Five years on, cameras flashed as Yvonne, radian in red, strode across a film festival stage with her bright-eyed son. Julian's hands clenched as he watched. \"Sir, the boy's four and a half,\" whispered his shaken assistant. Then, he rushed to the film set only to witness an A-list actor gently wrapping his arm around Yvonne's waist. \"I've booked your favorite restaurant for tonight's celebration.\"\nThe little boy blinked his innocent eyes at Julian, asking,\"Who are you? One of my mom's crazy admirers?\" He cornered her in the dressing room, his voice hoarse as he said,\"Let's remarry.\" Her lips curled slightly, but the smile didn't reach her eyes.\"The curtain's down; it's time to end this scene.\" But this time, he wasn't letting go.",

Get your people ready.” I couldn’t believe we actually have Lycans tonight I was told growing up that lycans and wolves were mortal enemies Rumors also said in order to protect their pureblood, Lycans were not allowed to marry wolves in generations. I was still surprised but I couldn’t let my mind wander anymore. I’m a doctor.\nA badly injured werewolf comes barging in through the E.R door, holding an unconscious wolf. I rush to them and the nurses that were already in their dresses and heels come to their aid. What the hell happened? I turn my full attention to the severely injured lycan and for a moment, it’s as if I can feel his slowing heart beat in my own chest. I check his vitals as a nurse reluctantly hooks him to all the machines. As I put my hand on his head to lift his eyelid and check for pupil response, I feel electricity run below my fingertips. What the….? Without warning, his eyes shoot open startling me and sending both our heart rates through the roof. He looks at me intently; I would never think those eyes are of a man who is barely alive.\nHe whispers something too low for me to hear. I get closer and as he whispers again; he flat lines and my head is reeling Did he just whisper... *mate?*",

    "description": "The door behind me opened. Alpha Adrian was smiling, looking at the man now standing before us both, but his face fell the second his eyes landed on me, shock and disgust filling his gaze. ‘Alpha King Rhys.” Adrian attempted to mask his disgust. “I must apologize. This foolish servant didn’t realize we would be meeting here.’ I nodded meekly. This was the Alpha King. Nothing good could come from me stumbling through here. Adrian grabbed me roughly by the shoulders and started to move. “She will be going now.’ “She can speak for herself.” The Alpha King’s aura made us both freeze. “What’s your name girl?”\n *****\nGrace spent her whole life in a pack that didn’t value her, and took advantage of her in every way they could think of. Her father, The Alpha at the time, allowed it to happen, and eventually even imprisoned her. When her father died, instead of things getting better, they just got worse. Her stepsister and her brother-in-law made her life a living hell. She never saw a way out as she was wolfless and mute because not speaking was safer than speaking. But she’s not as weak as she thinks she is. When Alpha King Rhys comes for a visit in hopes of finding a bride, her whole life changes. Nothing she knew is as it seemed, and now she’s unravelling the mess she was left with. With the help of the Alpha King, she starts to find herself, piece by piece.\nBut is she just a pawn in his game? He's had others before her.Is she the one he has been waiting for? Will she survive the mess she's been left in,or will she find herself crumbling before she can ever find the answers that await her?",

Her mate only kept her around to gain territory, and the moment he got what he wanted, he rejected her, leaving her broken and alone. Then, she met him. The first man to call her beautiful. The first man to show her what it felt like to be loved. It was only one night, but it changed everything For Lyric, he was a saint, a savior. For him, she was the only woman that had ever made him cum in bed-a problem he had been battling for years. Lyric thought her life would finally be different, but like everyone else in her life, he lied. And when she found out who he really was, she realized he wasn't just dangerous-he was the kind of man you don't escape from. Lyric wanted to run. She wanted freedom. But she desired to navigate her way and take back her respect, to rise above the ashes.\nEventually,she was forced into a dark world she didn't wish to get involved with",

    "description": "Gabriela learned her boyfriend had been two-timing her and writing her off as a brainless bimbo, so she drowned her heartache in reckless adventure. One sultry blackout night she tumbled into bed with a stranger, then slunk away at dawn, convinced she'd succumbed to a notorious playboy. She prayed she'd never see him again. Yet the man beneath those sheets was actually Wesley, the decisive, ice-cool, unshakeable CEO who signed her paychecks. Assuming her heart was elsewhere, Wesley returned to the office cloaked in calm, but every polite smile masked a dark surge of possessive jealousy.",
